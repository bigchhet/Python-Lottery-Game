#Lottery program. The program randomly generates a two-digit number, prompts the user to enter a single twodigit number,
#and determines whether the user wins according to the following rules. Write a loop to let the user
#play as many times as the user wanted. Use a sentinel or flag to quit out of the loop. You must pick the correct
#loop for this question. Each time the user continues to play, the program will generate a new two-digit random
#number until the user enters -999 to quit.
#1. if the user’s input matches the lottery in the exact order, the award is $10,000.
#2. if all the digits in the user’s input match all the digits in the lottery number, the award is $3,000.
#3. if one digit in the user’s input matches a digit in the lottery number, the award is $1,000.
